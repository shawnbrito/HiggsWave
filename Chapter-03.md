| <br/> | "Anthropology demands an open-mind, its so open that your brains fall out and pure imagination fills in."<br/><br/> ―-- Dr. Hans Infallibus|

A cold wind blew in as the driver side window slid down to reveal a young girl in her twenties. She stretched her had through the windows and handed her security pass to be swiped by the guard who replied ‘Your cleared to go Dr. Arugam".

The barrier gate lifted and the jeep rolled down the paved road. Moment later after parking her jeep, Tracy swiped her key card through the second layer of the security doors to gain access to the CERN engineering division. Walking towards her was a well built muscular man that she recognized instantly. A rapid surge of emotions flooded her face which could not be contained and she shouted out "Hans".  

Tracy had known Hans since the time he was ridiculed for proposing the possibilities of sauropods living in the middle of the Conganese jungles in central Africa almost fourteen years ago. Even though the analysis was impeccable, the procedures flawless, the documentation impervious to scrutiny, the conclusion were hilarious to say the least. Struck down with embarrassment and disappointment, Hans abandoned all hope in crypto zoology and pursued studies in particle physics, a field he continues to excel at. Fourteen years ago, that was his last encounter of anything crypto. Crypto zoology was an emerging idea in the nineteen nineties which never truly got traction nor any attention from the mainstream media. Although this particular field was ridiculed by the mainstream zoologists, some scientists actively pursue this due to their own philosophical beliefs and passions. Many crypto zoologists keep their thoughts and activities private until they have photographic or video evidence to share with the world. The fear of embarrassment still keeps most crypto zoologists under the public radar unto this day.

The elevator door opened wide as Dr. Hans and Dr. Tracy stepped in. "Basement 13th floor I presume?" said Dr. Hans. The elevator doors closed with a small hiss and gently descended into the bowels of the earth. 

Tracy replied, "Yes! I believe Dr Ervin has something he wants to show us. I hope he doesn’t have something completely reckless planned" To which Dr. Hans responded with a wide smile 
   "If I didn’t know Ervin any better, I would be extremely worried if he did do anything responsible". Looking up at the white ceiling in the elevator, he continued "Reckless is his middle name! do you remember the time when Dr Ervin started working on the Higgs accelerator units and there was a major breakdown in the Solenoid unit? It took over 1 year to repair the damages with the tax payers dollars. I distinctly remember that project being buried due to the cost it carried"

"Oh Indeed." replied Tracy, "I suppose since we’re in this together, we might as well enjoy the beauty and nature of the Swedish wilderness together. I know the lowlands are simple breathtaking. Just stay away from the upper hills. Too many bears come out from hibernation" she added. 

"I’ll certainly remember that, don’t want to cut my life expectancy in half" said Dr. Hans with a cheeky grin. The elevator had two sets of silver doors. One in the front and another set at the back. It looked like something from a science fiction movie. The elevator slowed down to a complete stop on the deep underground basement floor number 13.

Dr. Hans and Dr. Tracy stepped out into what appeared to be a hallway that led into a highly partitioned control room. A control room that looked more like a mini movie theater with dozens of large screens decorating the front of the control room. A short plastic wall separated small groups of engineers from other groups. Each group of engineers had 6 to 7 large LCD panels mounted on the short walls that displayed animated graphs. The computer systems looked like they were analyzing data using line graphs, bar graphs, inverted area graphs and Solenoid detector graphs. Some monitors showed animations of colliding atoms that were captured by the solenoid detector arrays. Cables to all the components were neatly packed and tunneled through conduits under each table. The room was also filled with a low buzzing noise originating from the transformers located towards the east end of the corridor. From the top of the control room, it looked a copy of the NASA control room.

"And here we are!" said Dr. Tracy. They were both standing in front of Dr. Ervin’s office. Dr. Tracy was about to open the door, when suddenly the door opened by itself with a greeting "Welcome back to my humble lab Dr. Hans, Dr. Tracy. Please sit down! We have so much work ahead of us". Dr Ervin was not much into pleasantries. The guilt he carried from his past failures was not much of encouragement for him and Dr Hans knew it.

"I see that you have been busy with the particle accelerator. Have you found anything new that might destroy our planet...", Dr. Tracy instantly jabbed him and interrupted Hans saying 
"Dr Ervin, thanks for inviting us to be participants in this great experiment. Is there anything you would like to share with us?"

Dr Erwin paced across the small room, nervously gazing through the large window. There was a sense of electricity in the air, a sense of urgency, a sense of fear or was it a sense of panic that kept Dr Ervin fixated on the LCD panels. Through the 7ft window, Tracy and Hans could easily see the large displays, the large collision graphs, the displacement energy output graphs. 

Based on Dr Hans experience, some of the charts were showing distinctive energy reading which he had seen before, a ghostly nostalgic feeling that this is something far worse than a nuclear explosion. However a nuclear explosion from a particle accelerator was ridiculously impossible. The energy output from a particle collision is not sufficient to power a light-bulk. 

One engineer lifted up a sheet of paper and showed it through the glass. Dr Ervin seems irritated by the readings, but dismissed it within himself. The silence of the room finally broke.

  "I have come to understand that you might have knowledge on the higgs wave oscillator experiments that were done some years ago by our friend Dr. Sanata".

Hans quickly responded with a grin, "You mean the famous Incident that took place 12 years ago. Well, apart from the cover up story, I know nothing about it. Anyways, isn’t it officially called the INCIDENT", he stressed, "due to the failure of the cooling system?".

Dr. Ervin stood emotionless, still staring through the office glass at the LCD monitors. A sense of anxiety filled the room. Dr. Ervin replied,
"The so called Incident that took place 12 years ago was kept under wraps due to the impossible nature of the incident. In simple English it means, it cannot happen. But the damn thing did."

He continued with more concern in his voice "when Dr Sanata executed the final test, something strange took place…." he paused for a while. He was shaking, his hands trembling and speech slurred.

A few sweat beads broke over his brow as he continued,
"Something unexpected… Something irrational… Something evil"

Dr. Ervin was serious about the cover up incident that took place 12 years ago. The incident was so complex it left millions of dollars of damages, and dismissed Dr Sanata from his work temporarily. Astonishingly something worth billions of dollars emerged, which equally warranted a cover up.

Tracy stood up as she was getting impatient with the monologue and asked, "Dr Ervin, Is there something you would like to share with us?".

Ervin grinned and walked towards a large steal cabinet. He was still trembling with fear. His fingers were shaking while he punched in the 4 digit code to the right of the handle and pulled the handle. The steel refrigerator opened with a white mist to reveal something that no human has ever see before. 

Tracy looked at the specimen and looked at Hans and said. "That’s a nice specimen you have Dr. Ervin! How did you manage to so intricately construct the Arthropleura"

With a heightened tone in his voice, Dr. Ervin replied "I didn’t make the damn thing, it made itself"
