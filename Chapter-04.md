## The INCIDENT

Incident Report TR-201708-21 August 2017 – 04:12 AM

Down the lonely corridor that leads to the underground Muon Solenoid chamber, a short balding man in his fifties fumbles through his cleaning equipment searching for the cleanex to mop the floor. The physicists lovingly called him Jack, short for Jackson A Richards, though no one knew his background as he kept things to himself. Jack worked the night shift janitorial position for over 18 years at HIVES mending the wending machines during the day and mopping the floors at night. Jack glanced at his watch, it was past 3:30 AM. The corridor air was stiff, with a scent of electrically charged particles. Although it was common for the corridor to smell like that during the day, it was uncommon for it to occur at night. It could be the residual energy he thought to himself. Jack reached for the cleanex and squeezed the bottle over the floor and went back to mopping as though there was no tomorrow. 

The lonely corridor curved round a meeting room and into another dimly lit passageway which descended through a steep flight of stairs into the Compact Muon Solenoid chamber which were only frequented by engineers when something goes wrong. Jack had almost completed mopping the corridor and was about to begin mopping the stairs that led down to the Compact Muon Solenoid chamber when a shadow caught his attention. Jack glanced at the time and mouthed softly

"Who’s working at 4:15 AM"

Back at the Lab, Dr Ervin conducted his tests on the premise of isolating the Higgs Boson through rapid collisions of heavy uranium atoms using the super collider at HIVES. He had summoned a meeting with all senior engineers to conduct a very lucrative experiment at midnight, however due to unforeseen computational errors the higgs wave oscillator was not fully calibrated. The enforcement fields were either took weak to hold the anomaly or too strong that it disrupted the wave oscillator itself. Frustrations we running high in the control room. Two engineers in lab coats vigorously disputed the energy reading generated from the Muon Solenoid.

One middle aged overweight engineer by the name of Denis said to the other, 
"The heck with it Steve, If we continue to ignore the feedback from the secondary wave, it could very well disrupt the continuum and send us all into a bloody worm hole". 

"Not if we time the secondary higgs wave with the reverse flux enforcement field to the very millisecond. I know we can do it since I already did that last week with the initial capacitor flux". replied the other.

Dr Ervin stood nervelessly and barked at everyone in a harsh loud voice.
"Enough.. all of you.. Focus on stabilizing the bloody wave. Its almost 4:10 AM, and I bloody well want to get some sleep tonight". 

The Muon Solenoid powered up to full capacity as heavy Uranium particles rushed through the tube at 98% the speed of light. Particle collision graphs began showing up colorful spectrum's of energy being dispersed.

One of the engineers stood to his feet hastily and rushed towards another console. He then rushed back to the operational console and mumbled in a soft voice to the other engineers. 
"It exploded, It exploded.. I’m not getting any readings from the Muon Solenoid.. Absolutely nothing". 

The other engineer looked strait in Denis’s eyes and confirmed it by saying 
"Denis! - I don’t think it exploded. I don’t think its not there anymore"

Dr. Erwin stood perplexed as to what was going on, still unaware of the drama that was unfolding between Denis and Steve. The Muon Solenoid had simply disappeared. 20 Metric tones of metal, plastic, steel and copper cabling had just vanished into thin air. And all within just 2 seconds. Denis looked at the time: 4:14 AM. "How would I describe this to Dr Ervin" he mumbled to himself.

"Dr Ervin", said Denis in a startled voice, "I can’t get any readings from the Muon Solenoid. I believe the connections may have been severed during the power surge, I'll go and check"

"Hey Denis", said Steve very softly, "I think you should first have a look at the surveillance camera. There’s something down there. I just saw it move across the pipes. There it is again, its a big long something."

Over 25 surveillance cameras were pointing at various angles at the solenoid assembly and pathways. Five pathways that were over 20 feet in diameter were established at the junction of the assembly in order to maintain and move large hadron pipes and assembly units. The mechanical engineers didn't want anything to slip through the cracks, especially the liquid coolant that kept the Muon Solenoid assembly below -269 degrees celcius. The complexity of the assembly was comparable to the assembly lines of the Shuttle Endeavour. The completed Solenoid assembly was expected to generate a strong 3.8 Tesla magnetic field which could align sub-atomic particles.

Now the coolant gas was fogging the camera's view and prevented anyone from getting a better look at the damage. Dr Ervin was still unaware of the extent of the damage, as the engineers largely kept things to themselves. Fearing that he might discontinue their research and possibly remove them completely from the project.

Back at the lonely corridor, Jack stooped down to put aside the cleanex and started advancing towards the stairway. He shouted hoping for a response "Anyone there?". But no response came back, except a soft rustle like dried leaves been stepped on continuously. Jack took out his flashlight and aimed it at the door at the bottom of the stairway. As the beam of light licked the floor, Jack began to see a dark shadow gently glide over the dark stairway. The dark shadown kept advancing towards him like a long black carpet being dragged along the floor. A distinct odor of rotting flesh pierced his nostrills and Jack turned aside to cover his nose.
A sudden jolt of intense pain shot through his right leg and Jack let out a blood curdling scream. The creature bit hard into the right fibula bone, injecting venom. Jack fell face forward hitting hard on the concrete steps. The creature let go of his leg, and Jack saw stars in front of him. As the venom started working through his veins, his chest started burning. Fluid started collecting in his lungs rapidly. He tried screaming "help....", but nothing was coming out of his mouth except slime and blood. The venom was slowly digesting his right leg from the inside. Jack with his last dying breath, crawled to a side and looked up and saw the hallway leading up the stairs. 'Just a few more steps to crawl up, and I will be out of this place' he said to himself. But all the while the long creature was continuously stalking him, waiting in the shadows of the coolant pipes. Waiting for its meal to be prepared from the inside out. Jack held the railing with his left hand and tried to stand on his left leg, but the pain was too intense, he was hurting all over. He simply could not feel his right leg anymore. Jack slipped and banged his left knee against the stairs and he let out another screem. But this time it was different.
The slow moving shadow was now on top of him, hissing with every breath. The distict odor of rotting flesh nausiated Jack and he threw up as the creature lunged and bit him in the stomach. Jack let out another blood curdling scream as he fell backwards against the stairs. The create overpowered him with ease, with every bite, it injected a concoction of deadly nurotoxic chemicals paralizing him from the chest down. Jack tried to screem, but his lungs were now full of fluid and he coughed mucus and blood. Jack reached out to grab the railing once again, but he knew, soon darkness and deep sleep would quickly overtake him.
