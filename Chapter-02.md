## The School

Mrs Plumber rambled along with her laser pointer in hand tracing the red glowing dot across the archaeological time-line which spread across the large projector screen. “As you can clearly see children, these layers of sedimentary rocks were laid down over hundreds of million years, The fossils that are buried tell us a long forgotten story of our past. A past that can be reconstructed using these precious pieces of evidence. They tell us a story of years gone by, how our ancient ancestor once ruled the earth millions of years ago” 

With a sense of pride in her voice, she continued, pointing at the layers and dogmatically confirming - “Each layer of rock that was laid down over millions of years tells us the history of that period, for example: the lowest layers are considered the Cambrian and Precambrian layers. The lowest layer being the Precambrian shows the beginning of life, where inorganic chemical formed into organic chemicals, which combined to form simple life forms over millions of years. Such interactions between inorganic and organic molecules formed the very basics of life”

She continued to assert,  “As many of you have read Dr. Dawkings book, the possibility of life forming is very remote – but not impossible. Simple organic modules condensing over folding crystals might have caused the very first proteins to unfold. Such simple folding and unfolding would give rise the basics of RNA molecules, which would give rise to the very first prokaryotes. Accidental merges of prokaryotic cells would then give rise to eukaryotes. In fact, such interactions are the fundamental building blocks of life as we see it occurring on planet earth today”.

Mrs Plumber was well versed in her biology class and knew how to convince the students of the amazing world of Biology, Geology and Anthropology. She was a smart teacher, though fair in complexion, and soon approaching middle age, she maintained her general figure through constant yoga practice. She had short blond curly hair and was well versed in the dynamics of school teaching. After all, 20 years of teaching should attribute for her convincing appeal to demand attention, especially when she dealt with geological & anthropological origins. 

Mrs Plumber may have not obtained her doctorate in Geology or Biology, but she certainly sported multiple qualifications in education, and she knew she was good at it. Her class respected her authority on the multiple subjects she so dogmatically infused into her audience with ease. 

Challenging Mrs Plumber would appear pointless and futile to one's intellectual position, hence the students avoided it cautiously. 

There was one particularly questionable incident that occurred 7 years back, when she requested the students to write “God is dead” in their textbooks. To her surprise, two students rejected to obey and caused a tremendous turmoil that escalated to dean of faculty. After understanding the risks involved, Mr. Plumber apologized and swore to not speak of it again.

Mrs Plumber was quite convincing to her students as she diverted their personal religious beliefs on the origins of man with scientific reasoning and a very convincing logical strategy. Many students in the class found her dogmatic reasoning to be conclusive to a point where many students began doubting the origins taught through traditional Sunday school. It's a known fact that many who once believed in the biblical creation were doubting the very existence of God in light of so called infallible claims made by dogmatic reasoning taught by scientist throughout the world over. Not many would stand up to such atheistic claims as the knowledge required to thwart the attacks were limited to an extreme minority. However not all was lost as there was one mischievous students who knew to sift through the intellectual dust – to separate Fact from Fantasy.

Melissa groaned in her spirit as she reluctantly listened to the claims Mrs Plumber so potently asserted in her class. She was keen on learning science, but alternative views that were falsely asserted to be science irritated her. A small scriptural passage passed through her mind.

“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge” (Prov 1:7)

Melissa was just 16 and hailed in from a devout religious family that observed all traditions laid out by the elders of the church. However, she knew deep in her heart there was more to it than just a bunch of traditions molded into a small birth certificate. She continued to pay close attention to Mrs Plumber’s charismatic utterances.

A sudden thought materialized in Melissa's head and she raised her hand. “Oh no, why did I raise my had”, Melissa thought to herself, but it was too late. 

“Yes Melissa, what's your question this time?” came the forward reply as Mr Plumber glanced at her with a disapproving look.

“Are those layers neatly sandwiched together and found throughout the geologic timescale as that diagram indicates or are they distributed by groups across continents?” replied Melissa.
Mrs Plumber did not like being interrupted and certainly did not like the question as it challenged the validity of the organizational structure of the geologic column.

“pssst, what are you doing Melissa?” floated a silent whisper from behind. It was Kyle Berns, her best friend from kindergarten, and he knew precisely what Melissa was up to. Kyle knew that Melissa was one step ahead of her class in Biology and Geology and knew she had something up her sleeve. But what was it this time, he couldn't fathom. Kyle was a mild tempered, mild mannered, fair in complexion, chubby lad and quite ignorant about his surroundings. His appearance was more childlike in manner and made him more adorable on account of his wide grin. Although his parents were business minded and owned a string of cosmetic shops, Kyle showed no intention of getting involved with his parents business affair.

Mrs Plumber frowned as she replied with a sense of agitation - “Each layer represent millions of years of sedimentary compaction and is dated by the fossils they contain. The layers represents the reality of the strata located along the columns, thus giving the age of each layer's placement within the geological record. Each continent sports the same geologic column, that's how we know they are universal”

Melissa knew immediately that her question was thwarted by intellectual gibber jabber, and her question itself was only partially answered with no bearing to the question itself. Melissa spent much of her time reading books by various authors, especially science journals. One of her favored authors were 'Dr Andrew Snelling' who wrote various science books. You could see 'hero worship' written all over her face whenever Dr Snelling's name popped up in class or during lengthy conversation at the cafeteria.

The school bell rang signaling the lunch break. While all the students scampered out the door, Kyle sat there intrigued and confused. Mellisa was about to leave but quickly sat down and said “Let me guess, you want to know what the heck the question was and what the heck that answer was”.. 

“Well Yeah, that would be helpful!” answered Kyle with the usual wide grin on his face. 

Kyle was not exactly the intellectual physicist, though he once won the spelling bee in first grade. His greatest victory of choice came when he positioned himself in 1st place at the inter-school swimming tournament, winning the 200m long course - free style event in just under 2 minutes 35 seconds. But that was 7 years ago when he wasn’t a chocoholic.

“The question I asked Mrs Plumber was - are there any evidence of actual layers of rock found in reality, not just the colorful pictures adorning my textbook. Those layers which are supposed to be millions of years are found only in our textbooks, and never found in reality. Sure there are layers all over the earth, but its no where near the details found in the textbook.” concluded Melissa.

“Many of those rocks layers that are found in our books do not really exist in reality, although some distinct layers do exist around the world with questionable ages. Remember Mrs Plumber mentioned that each layer is millions of years old?”.  Kyle nodded in approval.

“Well, don't you think there would be erosion points between layers, perhaps some peaks and dips, but all we see is perfectly sandwiched layers. As a matter of fact, the fossils within those layers are 3 dimensional – they have height, breath and width. Suppose we take the height of each fossil, we will be able to compute the rate of sedimentary deposit.” .. Kyles eyes glowed with inquisition while Melissa continue,

“For example: Suppose the Cambrian layer is 2 meters thick and that trilobite is just 5cm wide and 1cm thick, we can calculate the deposit rate using the following maths”.. as she passionately took out her notebook and began scribbling the mathematics.

2 meter layer = 200 cm
Deposit Time = 1,000,000 years
Triobite Thickness ~ 1cm
Deposit rate for 1cm = 1,000,000y / 200cm	~ =    5000 years

With a cheeky grin on her face, she whispered “I don't think any trilobite would remain exposed for 5000+ years waiting patiently to be eventually buried by sedimentary layers, in order to be eventually fossilized by minerals and eventually dug up by paleontologiests” she sighed and continued “What ever buried that little marine critter, buried it fast and killed it instantly”
Kyle raised his eyebrow and listened earnestly. His facial expression showing that he wanted to know more.
“What caused that trilobite to be buried rapidly?” Kyle replied. Melissa was waiting for that question with so much anticipation, she could hardly contain it..

With a single breath and a sanctimonious tone in her voice she uttered - “It was not just a mild mannered trilobite that got buried. It was everything on planet earth. It had to be a giant tsunami, caused by violent tectonic shifts. The shifting of the plates would have caused a global flood”. 

She took a deep breath once again and continued.

“A universal deluge possibly lasting for almost 1 year... A deluge where sediments are sorted based on the hydrodynamics forces of water compounded by the gravitational pull of the moon, occurring every day – The hot swirling mud would be rich in minerals. It was none other than a flood of biblical proportions”
Kyle was intently listening, his eyes not blinking, he stared at Melissa until she completed her sentence.
Melissa finally let it out “It was Noah’s Flood” 
Without hesitation, Kyle replied “C'mon Mel, that was a story taught in Sunday school. You seriously don't believe that Noah and that fossil Trilobite has anything in common now do you?.. Trilobites went extinct over 250 million years ago, that's where the lowest levels are recorded in the geologic column, hence they were buried the first, then complex organisms and then even more complex organisms..”

Melissa looked deep into Kyles eye's and gently whispered “There are scientific models that demonstrate the accumulation of multiple sedimentary layers over a period of just 1 month purely based on hydrodynamic sorting” Melissa replied hoping to convince Kyle that that sedimentary sorting can be accomplished under control conditions. She continued,

“The fossil record is based on hydrological sorting, and can be demonstrated in a lab under controlled conditions. It doesn't take millions of years to create a fossil” she continued to speak, while Kyle looked at her in disbelief.
“In fact the Biblical account of the Noahic flood explains the multiple layers found all throughout the world including the grand canyon. Many scientist today have verified that fossils can indeed form quickly, over a period of decades, perhaps a century to reach complete fossilization, but it never gets exposed due to scientific peer pressure. There’s far too much at risk if one begins to question the geologic column. The only scientists who take that kind of risks are those who trust God completely, and with unflinching loyalty” said Melissa.

Kyles mind began to drifting, the beams of sunlight that filtered through the window blinds made streams of gold. The shade of Mel’s hair looked like long curtains gently floating in the cool breeze of the night Saharan desert. He fair skin sported two dimples on her cheek, while the...

“Kyle, listen to me!” as she tried to refocus his drifting attention, “we have only been taught a single viewpoint for years, and never been shown the other side of the coin”.

Kyle's attention was quickly drifting once again as his  subconscious begand drifting down the hall. Kyle disregarded her religious statements as it made no sense. Words like God and Noah made Kyle drift in and out of consciousness.

Her attention was quickly diverted by an unearthly groaning sound from beneath...  “ooops sorry, I'm hungry..” came the reply from Kyle as his attention was no longer in that deep conversation. “Ok then lets move along” said Melissa, as they steadfastly made their way towards the cafeteria.


Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have guided missiles and misguided men. 
– Martin Luther King, Jr.

As touted by Naturalist, the last 110 years has seen the rise of science and technology take over the realms of religious dominance. In fact, the past 110 years has seen more discoveries than the past 5000 years. Science has been cradled as the next new religion in this ever changing world. It has given birth to new inventions from that which enables the lame to walk and blind to see, from building space ships to destroying islands with nuclear energy. 

Starting from the early 20th century with simple beginnings, science has uncovered the dynamics of the first radio waves. In 1901 Guglielmo Marconi invents the first wireless long range telegraph transmission signaling the beginning of wireless technology. In 1903 two brothers in Kitty Hawk succeeded with their motor powered flight. Orville and Wilbur probably never thought it would eventually become a commercial success worth trillions of dollars. Then in 1905 a German physicist names Albert Einstein published his very first book “Special Theory of Relativity” which became a roaring success and a stepping stone for nuclear physics.

Once the power of electricity was tamed, the 1920's saw the inventions of vacuum cleaners, electric shavers, televisions, spin dryer, electric refrigerator, frozen foods, speaker radio. There was no stopping the rapidly advancing science of the 20th century. And by the 1940's man made the seconds greatest mistake of all – he unleashed the power of the atom by inventing the very first A-bomb in 1945 in New Mexico.. Man's hunger for power didn't stop him, but fueled his rage to unleash that same untamed power on Hiroshima and Nagasaki just 1 month later. Later in 1947 William Shockley invented the transistor and permanently revolutionized the electric circuit –thus taming the first elementary particle – the 'electron'. In 1961 The Soviet Union puts Uri Gagarin into space signaling the beginning of man's space explorations. 

Each mathematical computation so meticulously calculated in order to achieve the closest possible accuracy in order to put man on the moon. And finally in 1969 US Apollo astronauts left their mark on the moon with these strong words - “One small step for man, One giant leap for mankind” was the words that echoed through the Houston Control Center at Dallas. It was former aircraft squadron leader Niel Armstrong taking his first steps on the lunar surface and uttering those memorable words.

Many of the above scientific achievements would not have been fathomed just 120 years ago. Explaining such developments to a scientist of the late 1800's would certainly warrant an immediate visitation to the local nut house. Based on historical evidence, science of the 19th century was well established awaiting minor refinements, such was the prevailing thought at the time by leading scientists. It would have indeed caused hysteria just mentioning the possibility of wireless communications using a small watch, or the possibility of reading ten thousand books using a device no larger than a cigarette case, or watching moving color images  stream across the airways from the comfort of your home, or explaining how our homes are powered by the partial annihilation of an atom. And all these great miracles purely depends on the disciplinary movement of electricity within a device no larger nor thicker than a postage stamp.

This account begins with the invention of the cyclotron by Ernest Lawrence in 1931. Its primary intention was to identify the building blocks of the universe. To identify how the universe began and what matter is primarily made of. Its ever increasing power demands to smash atoms, took on a new twist of faith. The discovery of the Higgs Boson by theoretical physicist Peter Higgs took place after 47 years of theorizing. 

However Peter Higgs did not fathom the possibilities of using quantum physics to travel within the space-time continuum. 

That concept was credited to an emerging theoretical physicists named 'Trevor Sanata' from Stanford College. In his theories, he discovered the alterations of space and time within the quantum space , causing elementary particles to permanently displace. Further studies at the CERN lab proved that this strange phenomena was reproducible with greater and greater granularity. The emerging subatomic singularity caused by the higgs boson ruptured the fabric of space & time, rather than simply augmenting it. Initial private demonstrations at CERN caused mixed emotions amongst the leading scientists stating it to be the 'mother of all horrors'. Some found it appealing as the singularity might posses unimaginable power or perhaps produce a framework for the theorized slipstream hyper-drive. 

Dr. Sanata later devised a mechanism to concentrate the higgs wave energy to form a molecular sized singularity. However, the artificial singularity was unstable and caused small portions of the CMS(Compact Muon Solenoid) to be absorbed by the singularity causing million of dollars in damages in the LHC(Large Hadron Collider). This incident occurred in 2009 and caused a large uproar from the public community. The devise was later decommissioned in light of extreme dangers posed by the unstable singularity created during higgs wave oscillation. The official press release stated that the accident was caused by a ruptured coolant tank overheating. The public relations department further strengthened this belief by touting negligence as the caused of the ruptured coolant tank, causing the entire magnetic pipe to be contaminated with liquid coolant gas. Months after the incident, Dr. Sanata was released from further experiments with the higgs oscillator, but continues to be part of the CERN research when time permitted.

However the truth remained buried for 4 years until CERN's leading scientists understood the theoretical aspects of controlling a molecular sized singularity with greater and greater accuracy. 

Proposals to unearth the higgs wave oscillator came under scrutiny as scientists voiced their legitimate concerns. Some went as far as stating that Earth itself would be absorbed into the quantum singularity if not properly controlled, some even stated that the 'higgs wave oscillator' should be built on the outer fringes of the solar system just in case. 

Nevertheless, the Higgs Wave Oscillator (HWO) was resurfaced and remodeled with higher intensity electromagnets sporting a maximum of 9 tesla units. The underdog of this great fiasco was none other than the charismatic and danger loving Dr. Ervin T. Senn. Unfortunately, he was also capable of single handedly convincing the counsel to resurface the higgs wave oscillator on grounds of discovering warp capabilities.

Dr. Ervin was a balding man in his late 50's with little hair to lose. His reckless behavior @ CERN was only outshone by the talents he had to accomplish the impossible. Even if it meant breaking the Harvard compact, which he never bothered to look up in detail. The rule book was too restrictive and mediocre and prevented him from exploring the unknown. The only other theoretical physicist who could challenged Dr. Ervin was Dr Hans Infallibus, who incidentally was back at the CERN institute touting his position on the radio halo experiments done by the RATE team @ICR. Dr Hans’s  conclusions was only convincing to eople who had a prior religious understanding in the biblical doctrines, though it made him somewhat of a scientific evangelist.

Dr Erwin walked across the hall with purpose in his stride, confident of making the higgs wave oscillator work with minimum complications. In a triumphant tone of voice he shouted “Once the wave oscillator is completed tomorrow, I will be able to demonstrate the fully functional capabilities of the warp travel”. He continued “The installation should be completed by tomorrow with the high intensity magnetic coil constraints” 

Dr. Hans interrupted by saying “What if the magnetic flux is insufficient to hold the intense gravimetric field generated by the bosons?. There is a strong possibility of a reverse feedback generated from the singularity, which in turn might feed the singularity itself causing it to morph into Einstein–Rosen bridge anomaly”.

Dr. Erwin immediate responding without hesitation said “Precisely Hans, Precisely,”
“There is a good potential for us to open a doorway to another star system or even another galaxy, in fact I intend to demonstrate this capability tomorrow by powering up the higgs wave oscillator to full power”

Dr Hans folded his arms, leaned against the wall and said with a disappointing but calmly tone, 

“Well, I just hope we live long enough to learn from our mistakes. History is riddles with man's mistakes. The problem is we never tend to learn from them.” said Dr. Hans and continued ;

“For example: we thought we learned something after the first world war was over in 1914, and we lost almost 19 million souls including those from the enemy. But apparently, we didn't learn a darn thing. Just 21 years later in 1939 we started another blazing war that lasted 6 flaming years. History is riddled with mistakes upon mistakes. The problem is not the mistakes itself, the problem is we never tend to learn anything from them.”

“Don't worry Dr. Hans, everything will be fine, the simulation tests confirm that HWO is fully capable of sustaining a temporary warp field” said Dr Erwin with a somewhat sinister yet comforting tone in his voice, while he reposition his bifocals. 

He further continued, “The temporary warp field will enable macro sized particles to travel through the space and time continuum without disrupting the molecular signature. The field tests done thus far confirms that 5 tesla units of power can transport up to 1 milligram of matter over 9 meters away in just under 2 picoseconds. I believe this single experiment alone proves that Gene Roddenberry's warp-drive was not too far from the truth”.

Dr Hans listened carefully and said “Well, too bad Mr. Roddenberry is not here to see his dream become reality” as he turned away from Dr. Erwin and headed down the hallway to the main control center.
