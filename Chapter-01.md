| <br/> |  "If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning."<br/><br/> -- C.S. Lewis|

As the morning sun arose over the horizon, her eyes caught the sparkling dew drops on the green grass.  It has been 2 years since she completed her field ornithology thesis, and 8 months since she returned to the Jura mountains which was just 45 minutes away from the concrete jungle she called home. The scenic view was unmatched by any standard; and driving through the winding hillside roads with the distant snowy mountains peaking above the tall green roadside foliage made it even more mesmerizing.

Tracy was well established in her field ornithology and was well renowned for her contributions at the University of Geneva. Those who knew her well teased her of being the Dian Fossey of the 21st century. The cool misty air enveloped her like a thick blanket as she moved away from her parker jeep. The quiet still air was only broken by the rustling leaves above the open forest canopy and cheering songs of playful birds. While she sat on a small rock besides the running flow of water, looking over the green foliage and beyond the tree lines, she could see the concrete jungle in the far distance rising above the undulating mountains and lains. It gave her a sense of being in two places at the same time. Far enough from the busy urban life, but close enough to rush home and prepare for the busy schedule ahead.

Dr. Tracy was just 29 years and gifted with the desire to explore the great outdoors. She was also gifted with a light tan complexion and long black hair that ran down to her waist. Standing at 5ft 8”, she was a fitness fanatic, believing in the impossible dreams that were never possible by people of the past. One of her well established and repeated philosophical quotes were:

    “If you believe you can do it – Your Right! ”
    “If you believe you cannot do it – Your Right as well!”..

On multiple occasion, she quoted Dian Fossey's experience in the wild, which earned her the nickname 'Tracy Peahen'. That’s what the boys at the University used to say behind her back when ever no one was looking. Her style of dress was also unique after all Dr. Tracy was a field ornithologist and needed to be quick and light on her feet.

Today she felt more comfortable wearing extreme shorts and a khaki teeshirt while scouting the outdoors for the elusive Eurasian Blue Jay. To be out alone among the wildlife gave her a sense of adventure, excitement and authority. A sense of swimming against the flow of the mediocre and mundane, it made her feel very much alive. There was a... “Yes, this is Tracy Arugam here... good morning Dr Erwin.. Yes!, I can be there by 9:00 AM... Will do...Bye!” As she slipped her phone back into her gray trouser pocket, she felt a sense of urgency in Dr Erwin voice. Something was not right back at the faculty.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawnbrito/HiggsWave/master/images/blue-jay-quilling.jpg" align="right" width="350"> “I could've been here all day and documented the mating behavior of the Blue Jays” She thought to herself. But it was almost 7:00AM and she was called in for an urgent meeting at 9:00AM. An urgent meeting with the Dean of Faculty and a hand-full of 'experts'. That's what Dr Erwin said in his 7 second conversation.

Mumbling to her self... “hope no darn brown bears around....”, she scampered over the rock and landed on her feet inches away from a broken jagged bottle. “darn kids...” she mumbled and quietly walked back to her Nissan petrol jeep parked 100 yards to the east. 

The sound of singing jays filled the air with a colorful assortment of sound. As she walked through the wide forest keeping the running stream to her left, she noticed tracks in the mud. Momentarily distracted by the rustling wind, her thoughts went back to her academic studies in zoology. With its distinct shape and size, it could only be made by one particular animal. However her attention was not on the size nor the shape of the imprint, but rather on the depth of each footprint. She bent over and gently placed her finger into the imprint - “shit, thats almost an inch deep and I've hardly made any bootprints in this hard mud” She thought to herself.

The footprint was indeed fresh, as a matter of fact a bit too fresh for comfort. She froze in silence and listened patiently, but all she heard was the singing jays above. Looking down she quickly realized these tracks were made by a large male bear roaming the land for possibly herbs & berries. She paused and took a deep breath, anxiety began to fill her heart. Her pupils fully dilated she looked around for any signs of movements. Wild thoughts began to fill her mind. Was there a bear hiding behind the foliage waiting to defend his territory? Or was it stalking her for breakfast?. 

Both possibilities were equally frightening to Tracy as she slowly pulled herself together and continued walking back to her jeep. 70 yards more to go...  60 yards more to go... she paused for a moment. 
she could hear the sound of her heart beating in the quietness of the forest. “quietness of the forest?, thats not good. There’s a predator around?”.
Looking around, she thought she caught a glimpse of something moving in the distance. Not more than 50 yards away from her, there was only one thought in her mind “do I have enough time to sprint for the Jeep”. 

The forest was wide with cypress trees growing every 10 feet with tangled wines falling from above. The Jeep was within eye contact, just momentarily disappearing around the shrubs only to reappear once again. She continued to move forward slowly.... 40 yards to the jeep.... 30 yards to the Jeep... 20 yards to the Jeep.... Her heart was still pounding from the adrenaline rush as she pondered the thoughts of been mauled to death by a bear. She was now walking through soft sediment along the waters edge, and it felt awkward trying to move through the muddy banks of the stream that sank her leather boots up to her ankle.. She thought to herself -There was no way to outrun a full grown brown bear as they have been clocked at 30 mph on the open planes. The only educated option would be to stand your ground and make enough noise to warn the bears of pending human encounters. Of course it would also spell out 'dinner is ready' to every bear in the county.. Hence that thought was not completely forthcoming for Tracy as she quietly moved along the banks counting.. Just 20 yards to safety but it looked so far away, and then through the green foliage, directly above the rocky outcrop, a large black shadow stumbled into clear view. Tracy turned her head to look at the shadow and froze.

## The Coffeecup

The room was quiet with a smell of burnt tobacco. The café Latte on the Hill was special in many ways that it brought about a sense of peace & imagination to those seeking quietness. Its secluded location on the side of the hill made it a stunning attraction for foreigners and local tourist to rate it as the little coffee shop on the hill. Looking through the large glass window of the coffee shop, a dark tanned man sat at his table with his hands clasped together in deep thought.
Placing his cup of coffee on the table Dr Hans looked intently at his triple sensor watch and noticed a temperature drop of 1' C within 5 minutes. Looking back at his coffee, he simply dismissed it with a shrug of his shoulders believing it could be due to the cool evening breeze that hummed through the coffee shop hallway.. 

Dr Hans was 5ft 8” broad shouldered and well built for a 36 year old theoretical physicist at SLAC National Accelerator in US. However due to his background in particle physics, he had closer associations with CERN in Switzerland. In recent years, Dr Hans has been heavily engaged in the string theory that has most physicists living on the borders of chaotic madness. His constant affinity to ware turtlenecks earned him the nickname Steve Jobs though his personality and affiliation couldn't be further apart from Mr Jobs. 

What set Dr Hans apart from the rest of the theoretical physicists was his unflinching loyalty to certain ancient doctrines which he lovingly called Bible stories. Some of his colleagues found it disturbing that a fellow educated and distinguished scientist would still be holding onto an ancient relic from the distant past. 

“Would you like to have another coffee professor?” asked the sweet waitress across the room. Lost in thought he paused for a second and answered quietly “Hmm.. Oh.. Yes please..”

As a leading physicist at the CERN, Dr Hans theorized the possibility of clumps in the space and time continuum. His dogmatic thinking fueled the ongoing construction of the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. He went as far as postulating that particles were not simply made of elementary particles, but were made of vibrating space. Each vibration frequency caused the space within to crumple and create a unique elementary particle. He further propose that space & time vibrations can cause the spontaneous occurrence of a quark or an electron, but never a proton or neutron as these were far too heavy and complex to be spontaneously created and destroyed.. Independent studies of this theory has proven even more complex pattern in quantum theories fueling physics to determine the origin of the universe. Nevertheless, string theory was later validated by other independent theoretical physicists in the field and made Dr Hans propel to academic stardom.
Dr Hans was famous for breaking all known rules and theorizing the universal concept of electromagnetic radiation. His dogmatic theories about “one force – multiple frequency” on the electromagnetic spectrum has inspired thousands of scientist the world over to analyze and theorize the quantitative power of the entire spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. Ranging from simple fridge magnets, MRI scanners, to visible light all the way up to gamma rays, Dr Hans proposed that they are all one force with multiple frequencies..

What many scientists and professors did not understand was that Dr Hans was also a student of biology, secretly studying the genetic variability of organisms in order to demonstrate his biblical presuppositions. His most recent genetic discovery was the “Blind Mexican Tetra” which was erroneously shown by scientist to be a hallmark of evolution. Dr Hans rebuked these initial findings to be nothing more than a preexisting genetic variable – perhaps a ”Waddington’s Widget” being suppressed or activated by external influences. He later identified the actual cause to be with a particular protein strand HSP90 or heat shock protein 90 – or rather the lack of this protein to be more precise. He later demonstrated it in the lab how the inhibition of HSP90 could result in the significant degeneration of eyes and limbs. He later threw a wrench into the Tetra evolution theory, by cross breeding blind and sighted Tetra on his window in plain visible light. To his amazement, the subsequent generations were all born with well developed eyes.

It was almost sunset and Dr Hans intently stared through the glass window holding his cup of coffee close to his lips. Through the corner of his eyes, he noticed a blue Toyota sedan pull up by the side of the hill. Dr Hans squinted and identified the man instantly.

## The Eurasian Bear Encounter

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawnbrito/HiggsWave/master/images/bear3.jpg" align="right" width="50%"> Tracy's academic knowledge took over and she began to shout at the bear while frantically jumping up and down. 

“Hey bear, go away, I'm not your food. I'm too skinny anyways. hey bear. leave this place. go away.” she shouted while yet slowly inching her way towards the Jeep. The bear stopped and look intently at her while yet sniffing the air above. 
The bear looked calm without fear and without distraction, possibly wondering what this noisy animal was. 

Her throat muscles tightened from the tension and anxiety, her heart still pounding in her chest, Tracy lifted up her hands high above her head hoping it would make her look bigger and shouted once again. She was now just 10 yards away from the Jeep, but the bear appeared to be even closer. Her heart pounding hard in her chest, she could feel the beads of sweat drip off her nose. An academic thought popped into her “do not show fear... do not show fear.. it can smell the hormones in the air... in can smell fear.. control yourself Tracy... breathe..” she said to herself..

Now just 5 yards to the Jeep, she believed that she could just about make it without compromise. Adrenaline rushed through her blood as she prepared to make one final shout at the bear, but that would to no avail as the bear moved closer to her. There was only one thing that remained, all other possible optioned were exhausted. She had to make a quick decision now... Without a moments hesitation, she made a wild dash for the door handle... Grabbed the door handle and unlocked the door and jumped in without a looking back. But she then realized that the door was stuck and didn't close after her. Her heart still pounding in her chest, she was hyperventilating as the Jeep rocked to a side. Still shaking from the adrenalin rush, she fumbled around to find the cause and saw a long twig stuck between the door and frame. “oh great, just great” she mumbled to herself. 

Her heart was still pounding, her mouth dry from breathing fast, she grabbed the twig with one hand while yet holding onto the door with the other, she pulled the twig in with one final breath and completely shut the door.

Tracy looked through the window and realized the bear was trying to gently push the door in. There was nothing to stop a 500 pound brown bear from taring a metal door open like a paper cup. The only available option was start the Jeep, put it in gear and drive down the hill without aggravating the giant any further. And thats exactly what she did without further delay. The Jeep started and rumbled down the hill, tires gripping the road tightly as she rushed past the bear. Not a few seconds went by while she was yet driving down the gently curving hill, she realized that the bear was not at all attacking but was rather curious about the strange foreign animal in its territory. If it truly was attacking Tracy, she would've been dead by now. Eurasian brown bears were not known to attack people on purpose, though there ware thousands of documented encounters in these parks.

She looked in the rear view mirror and saw the brown giant nibbling on the berries amongst the green foliage that soon disappeared from sight as she curved along the winding hill.

## Paul Longhorn

Paul stepped out of his blue Toyota sedan, briefcase in hand and a lighted cigarette between his lips. He wore a black unbuttoned suit and seemed irritated – possibly by the hilly location Dr Hans selected prior to their meeting. He moved swiftly towards the coffee shop ignoring the waitress nearby who bid him 'good evening'.. Paul was a thin balding man in his fifties and was the head of the Biological Institute in Colorado.  Paul took risks in applying biological untested agents in production cultures in order to demonstrate his temporary theories. In his final conquest to prove that banana productions can be doubled in South America for half the cost, Paul unleashed semi tested ripening agents that altered the ratio of the Brix-Acid index. This was later found to cause massive skin irritations among the local population and was abandoned by the scientists working under Paul. 

Paul extended his hand towards Dr Hans and shook it with a tight grip “Welcome back to Switzerland Dr Hans, were quite greatful that you arrived on such short notice. You were in US for almost 3 years working on that large atom smashing thingy...” 
Dr Hans interrupted him with these precious words “You mean the SLAC National Accelerator... yes.. almost 3 years..”

Dr Hans was well versed in Paul's mischievous experiments in India, Thailand and South America just to name a few, though he kept the information to himself with a genuine smile.

“Would you like to have some coffee?” inquired the waitress who was dressed in a white silk buttoned shirt and brown pants. 

“No thanks....” came the answer from Paul as he laid down the papers from his briefcase onto the table. 
Paul looked strait at Dr Hans strait in the eye and said “Lets get down to business.. Shall we?'.. “I have been investigating a rare phenomena occurring in the Congo swamps in Africa”. 

“There were reports of some strange incident of the Ebola virus in the regional community... The problem lies not with the Ebola, but rather with the location these so called incidents were reported last year”.. Dr Hans leaned forward in his chair and frowned as he listened to Paul continue.. “They were all reported from the Congo basin around Lake Télé”..

“I believe you have done certain sensitive research on Lake Télé in the past Dr Hans, and I would like to..”

Hans interrupted him immediately “For peats sake man, get over it. I did that research 15 years ago and concluded that it was all based on folklore... Besides I never truly investigates the Congo basin itself.. I was only 20 at the time and I wanted that diploma badly.. The paper I wrote was mostly within the village vicinity and nowhere near the inner lakes, besides the Jungles are impenetrable and lakes difficult to navigate. I suppose you could do it today with modern GPS equipment, but the cost of mounting an expedition to Lake Télé is steep... I know for a fact that no one in the local village will help you as they are respectful and equally fearful of the Lake Télé phenomena..”

Dr Hans continued “Those legend of Mokèlé-mbèmbé were circulating for over 200 years since the first Christian missionaries began entering the swamps in search of savage natives.. I'm just glad they did a good job as there are no more 'savage natives' to be found... just 'natives'..”

“Numerous expedition have been undertaken by naturalists and scientists alike, but the outcomes are very questionable.. Most reports contain vague sightings that were argued by crypto zoologists to be a large sauropod, while others were disregarded as pure fantasy.”

“The second complication is the equipment damage.. The humidity is rarely below 95% and all electrical equipment needs to be fully weather resistant through and through.. Even if you do get such equipment weatherproofed, how will you analyze the recorded material? How will you be able to differentiate wildlife from condensation on the lens or even the foliage without ejecting the tape or disk first and analyzing them on a computer, which incidentally needs to be all weather resistant as well?”

“I know you mean well Paul, but you need to let it go. I know it would sound amazing, wild and ambitious finding a living sauropod in the 21st century, but the cost of an expedition and equipment is not entirely up to the challenge yet. Even if you did succeed in finding a living sauropod, you would be the only eye witness, along with your crew who may not last through the night. Many known micro & macro organisms in that region are designed especially to strike, envenomate, kill and consume.” 

Dr. Hans leaned forward and continued. 

“The last expedition mounted by the History Channel reported large underwater serpentine shapes based on Sonar reading, along with caves with multiple vents, but that's it. They never found the mega fauna, I would not take that risk to find an elusive creature that has managed to escape the sightings of trained professionals”. 

Dr Hans looked strait at Paul and said 

“If your that serious about finding that sauropod, speak to Dr. Roy P Mackal, he's an expert in crypto zoology. In fact he's world renowned for his obsessions with Mokèlé-mbèmbé and Lochness” 

Pointing at the gold picture frame that hung neatly on the orange sand coated wall – Dr. Hans continued “You need to speak with him before he dies of old age.”  Neatly hung on the side wall, It was an old gray shaded picture of Dr. Roy Mackal in the jungles of Peru, holding what appeared to be a 2 foot long disembodied head of a giant Anaconda.

Paul reluctantly moved his glaring eyes away from the old faded picture of Dr Mackal and slowly glanced at his watch and with much disappointment in his tone said in a humble voice “Yeah, I wish that were possible. Dr Mackal died a few years ago in 2013. Anyways, if your unable to join the expedition to the Congo, I might have to organize another established scientist. At least that should work” he continued with a grin on his face,  “I'll appeal to his wallet... that generally has a positive response.”

“Your going to the Congo?” asked Dr Hans. “Yes, I'm mounting an expedition to central Africa next week. And as you sternly mentioned, I would need to tweak a few equipment to make them all weather proof”, He paused for a moment and continued “whats the use of having a good scientists if you can't take their advise?”

Paul impatiently looked at his watch and said - “Well, It was nice meeting you Dr Hans after so many years, hope we would meet once again soon..”  as he stood up and walked strait out the Coffee shop.. Dr. Hans felt uneasy speaking to Paul as there was a sense of recklessness, a sense of greed, a sense of reckless scientific gluttony in Paul's endeavors.

Dr Hans knew it would indeed take a miracle to find the elusive Mokèlé-mbèmbé, as it has eluded the camera for decades. It would take a miracle just seeing a wild herbivorous sauropod with your naked eyes, let alone capture it on film. - A large 4 legged, plant eating, possibly warm blooded, territorial, long necked, long tail, semi aquatic, Apatosaur -  That's what Paul was chasing after; a bloody living dinosaur.

>Roy P. Mackal (August 1, 1925 – September 14, 2013) was a University of Chicago biologist best known to the general public for his interest in the Loch Ness Monster and other cryptozoological entities.
>
> During the 1980s, Mackal turned his attention to another legendary creature, the Mokele-mbembe, an alleged living dinosaur in the Likouala swamp region of the Republic of Congo. Accompanied by University of Arizona ecologist Richard Greenwell and Congolese biologist Marcellin Agnagna, Mackal undertook two expeditions, the first in 1980 and the second in 1981, to find and photograph the creature. Mackal himself did not actually see the creature, but he and his colleagues did collect multiple firsthand reports from Congo natives, who, according to Mackal, consistently described a creature similar to a long-necked sauropod. During his interviews with the natives, Mackal also heard anecdotes about the Emela-ntouka, another possible living dinosaur which supposedly resembles a Monoclonius or Centrosaurus, the Mbielu-Mbielu-Mbielu, which is said to resemble a Kentrosaurus, and the snake- or lizard-like Nguma-monene.
